### QUALITY OF SERVICE MONITOR <br/>Interface Design Description

---
# Security

This System can be secured via HTTPS. If it is started in secure mode (default behaviour), it verifies whether the Application System possesses a proper X.509 identity certificate and whether that certificate is Arrowhead compliant in its making. This certificate structure and creation guidelines ensure:
-	Requester system is properly bootstrapped into the Local Cloud
-	Requester system indeed belongs to this Local Cloud
-	Requester system has right to access to the specific endpoint

# Communication Profile

QoS-Monitor offers three types of endpoints. Client, Management and Private.

Swagger API documentation is available on: `https://<host>:<port>`.<br/>
The base URL for the requests: `http://<host>:<port>/qos_monitor`.
